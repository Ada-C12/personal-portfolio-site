How I did this...<br>
In my repo, I clicked on settings, then scrolled 75% down the page to the GitHub pages section.<br>
I clicked on the Source dropdown menu and chose Master branch. <br>
Then the website refreshed and I see a light green section right above me, with a checkmark saying my page is published<br>
Clicking on that site, brings me to the README.md, so I went up to the URL bar and added /lib/index.html<br>
That worked.  But do I want to have to type it manually everytime? Nope! <br>
So I rewrote README.md as an html file (but I kept the .md file extension), and added in a \<a href\> link with my correct URL!

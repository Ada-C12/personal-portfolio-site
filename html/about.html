          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            I started learning how to code just over a year ago when I took free
            online classes, such as from the CodeAcademy and Free Code Camp,
            mainly learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some SQL. Following that,
            I took a web development class at my college that gave me a solid
            foundation to build upon. Late last year, I completed an
            introductory programming class at my college that focused on Python
            language. Additionally, I completed the Ada Developers Academy Jump
            Start program in preparation for my Ada application.
          </p>
          <p>
            The thing that I love most about programming is that it gives me the
            opportunity to solve problems and think critically in addition to
            how it allows me to build things that serve a purpose. I am very
            interested in developing projects that others can interact with, and
            programming allows me to do just that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I am a student at Ada Developers Academy where I am
            training to become a Full Stack Developer. I feel very lucky to have
            been given such a wonderful opportunity to learn and work with such
            wonderful people.

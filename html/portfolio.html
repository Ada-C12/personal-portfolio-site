              We will build a calculator command line interface (CLI) that
              allows any user to interact with the command line to perform
              simple arithmetic. The program should ask the user to type in and
              enter in pieces of input. Based on the input that the user typed
              in, the program should output its evaluation.

              Rideshare Programs are systems that help people organize
              carpooling/vanpooling. Some popular on-demand rideshare apps, like
              Lyft and Uber, store and use data on riders, drivers, and trips,
              particularly data on when a trip happened, who was the driver, and
              who was the rider.

              An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters
              of a different word or phrase. Adagrams is a fictional game in
              which a player is given a random set of letters and must make an
              anagram using those letters. Adagrams has a specific scoring
              system, so that the player's submitted anagram scores points. The
              rules for Adagrams are roughly inspired by the "Letter Round"
              portion of the British game show Countdown.

              A company has been contracted to build a booking system for a
              small hotel. This system will be used by employees who manage
              bookings and booking data, and will not be available to the
              general public.

            <p class="project-description">
              To practice working with APIs, we will utilize the API for a tool
              with which you already very familiar: Slack! The application we
              build this week will be designed for humans to use. This means the
              format will be familiar to us, but it seems a little silly - why
              would you use the command line when you could just use the app?
              However, there are many places where you might want to use Slack,
              where it doesn't make sense to have a human in the loop. For
              example, you might set up a continuous integration tool like
              Travis CI to run your tests automatically whenever you submit a
              pull request.

              A team of ambitious and passionate folks have assembled and
              they're creating a new product called Startrly. Startrly is a new
              and unique solution for some problem, and it's going to disrupt
              some industry. They've hired you to make a new front-page for
              their product's website. They have a good idea for what they want
              in their front page in terms of layout and content, so they've
              provided wireframes and the HTML for the front page. However, in
              terms of literal styles, colors, and visual design choices...
              they've left that freedom to you.

              It's common for developers to create a website to show off their
              web-dev skills and document their work and interests. These sites
              often feature things like: A professional introduction of
              themselves, careers, and interests A portfolio of projects that
              they've created and/or collaborated on A blog to share their
              experiences, thoughts, and/or subject matter expertise Other

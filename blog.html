      One of my favorite things is to travel! I love to meet new people, learn about new cultures and experience them.
      I enjoy to use public transportation, get to know the locals and participate on cultural events.
      For me there is confort in the unknown... I guess it is just my nomad heart speaking!
      I've been to 3 continents, 13 countries, speak 3 languages and counting...

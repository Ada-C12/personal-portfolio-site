        i'm officially a third of the way through becoming a fullstack developer, and it's a surreal feeling. 
        more than just the tangible knowledge its brought me, i feel so much more confident in actually doing
        the projects that i get ideas for, outside of programming. its a new feeling to see myself as capable 
        of doing the things i want to do. now i get to enjoy a week off and spend a lot of time in the bathtub!

       i wonder if i have anything to talk about that isn't programming anymore. i am a huge fan of the CSS and front end
       portion of our curriculum so far. it is such a relief to be learning something that i excel at naturally! i'm excited
       to learn whatever comes next, but for now i am savoring the ease in which i could understand lessons and projects this 
       week. i could see myself doing this endlessly. on the otherhand, algorithms help exercise my brain more and feel amazing
       when i figure them out. so overall, i hope i end up somewhere where i get to do a little of both.

        ive been thinking about my capstone project a lot recently for some reason. i think i just like to be prepared because
        i know i'm a slow decisionmaker. i met a C11 student who told me about her project and it had to do with feeding APIs into
        a webpage which cause animated graphics to appear. i want to do something like that. i am really drawn to the idea of not
        creating something solely based off of its purpose, and practical implications. i like to think that it is just valuable to
        create for yourself, and the things which you want to exist.

        i went to this really cool garden rooftop during lunchtime at school with a sandwich. there was a few tourists who'd found
        the place too but it wasn't too crowded. you could see over the sound and the pier, and it was full of plants with different 
        seasonal vegetables. i think it's my favorite place in the downtown area. i hadn't realized how wound up id felt in my shoulders
        and how good it felt to relax in the sunlilght.

          What a fun and unique place!  This is now my favorite dessert spot in Seattle!</br></br>
          I highly recommend the Snowdaes.  They are hard to describe, but they basically take sweetened pureed fruit + milk and freeze it into a block.  
          Then, they shave that into thin ribbons and serve it with some toppings on the side.</br></br>
          It kind of tastes like ice cream, but the shavings make it really light and fluffy.  
          I had the Taro Mein Mein Ice, which was like a deconstructed bubble tea.  
          It was a mountain of taro shavings garnished with tapioca balls and diced fruit.  It was heavenly.</br></br>
          My husband had the Mango Mein Mein Ice, which was also good.  That one came with pieces of fresh mangoes and strawberries.</br></br>
          The lady at the front counter was really nice (even though we needed help ordering) and there was plenty of seating available inside.  
          They also have an extensive menu with many other types of desserts.</br></br>
          The only downside is the price.  Snowdaes are kind of expensive at $7.95 each.  
          However, you do get a huge portion (enough for two people to share).  
          I had no problem scarfing one down by myself though, because they are really delicious and way better than ice cream, shaved ice, or bubble tea!</br></br>

            My husband and I have watched clips of Mat Franco on America's Got Talent, but it was really different and exciting to watch him perform live in Las Vegas!  
            Mat is a talented magician with a charming personality and a great sense of humor.  He is an excellent entertainer and it was a really fun show.</br></br>
            Mat uses audience participation for several of the tricks, so the performance really feels personalized for each group.  
            I was really lucky and got picked for one trick, which was really cool and made the experience even better!</br></br> 
            I suggest sitting as close to the stage as possible.  We had a great view from Row CC, Seats 3 and 4.  
            There was a small side table between our seats, which I thought was weird, but not a big deal.  
            There is a camera and TV screen for some of the close up magic tricks.</br></br>
            The theater is located on the 3rd floor of the LINQ hotel.  They have pretty good signs around the hotel.  
            Go to the bathroom before you go into the theater.  I highly recommend showing up around 30 minutes before the show.  
            Ushers escort people to their seats, which is a nice touch, but takes time.</br></br>
            The drink service is slow, which is another reason to arrive early.  
            They don't take orders during the show, so ask for all of your drinks at the beginning.  The show is about 90 minutes long with no intermission.  
            You can't take photos during the performance, but we got some after the show and outside of the theater.</br></br>

          I had a very positive experience at Honda of Seattle, so I would definitely recommend this car dealership!</br></br>
          The location is pretty convenient, since it is close to I-5.  They have a nice showroom with several new cars in the lobby.  
          The rest of the cars are located upstairs in a covered parking garage, so it is easy to go car shopping, even when it is raining.  :-)  
          They also have a comfortable waiting room with TV, Wi-Fi, coffee, and muffins.</br></br>
          Honda of Seattle is a "no haggle" dealership, so they are very upfront about their pricing and the employees don't work on commission, so there is no sales pressure.  
          Their website is pretty useful because they keep it updated with their current inventory and you can see actual pictures of the car or read the Car Fax.
          I wasn't ready to buy a brand new car, but I was also worried about the reliability of a used car.  
          I ended up getting a certified car instead, which was a good compromise.  
          Honda certified cars go through a thorough 182 point inspection and any worn parts are reconditioned or replaced.  
          They also come with a 7 year/100k mile limited powertrain warranty and 1 year/12k mile limited non-powertrain coverage.  
          I don't think my car is going to break down anytime soon, but I feel better knowing that I have some kind of warranty.</br></br>
          I visited this location several times, so Breland, Francisco, and Anthony helped me on different days.  
          They were extremely professional, helpful, and patient, so I enjoyed working with all of them.  
          Even though I bought a used car, they worked really hard to answer all of my questions and made sure that everything was perfect.  
          I've been doing my research, so I think the car I chose was priced very reasonably, which made everything really easy.  
          Also, when I went to pick up the car, it was detailed and had a full tank of gas, so I felt like I was leaving with a brand new car.  
          Thank you for all of your help guys!  I'm really happy with my car and I look forward to coming back for my regularly scheduled car maintenance.  :-)</br></br>

          My husband and I met Nash Fung at the Weddings in Woodinville event.  We never planned on getting a magician for our wedding, but we absolutely loved Nash's personality, sense of humor, and his impressive magic tricks.  We hired him to perform at our cocktail hour and he was a total hit with our guests.  Nash did close-up magic tricks with common objects (playing cards, coins, marker, floss, etc).</br></br>  
          Nash is an excellent magician and he performs tricks that I've never seen before.  For examples, you should go to YouTube and search for his performances on Penn & Teller: Fool Us (Driver's License Trick) or Evening Magazine (Gum Wall Trick).</br></br>  
          Besides providing wonderful entertainment, Nash was also a great ice breaker.  He's really good at mingling with strangers and introducing people to each other.  Many people at our wedding had never met before, so Nash's magic was a great way to bring various groups of people together.  Nash also performed a special trick for my husband and me, which we loved.</br></br>  
          Nash has really classy magic tricks, so his act is definitely not cheesy.  He is good at entertaining adults, but he is also family friendly.  We had about 90 adults at our wedding and two children, but everyone loved him.  Even my guests who couldn't speak English were amazed!</br></br>  
          I've also been to his stage show and he is skilled at entertaining large audiences.  Besides weddings, Nash performs at colleges, birthday parties, and corporate events.  We are so glad that we booked Nash for our wedding because he really made our special day more memorable!</br></br>

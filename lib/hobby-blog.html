    <h3>Travel</h3>
    <p>As much as I love to stay home for free, when I do get to travel I keep it action-packed.  
      Two of the pictures above are taken in this lovely German town called Miltenberg, 
      and their buildings are the stuff of fairytales.  I appreciate all the beauty that is 
      in this world, from natural sceneries to architectural marvels, from breathtaking art 
      to the warmth of simple country folks... Travelling the world really is one of the best 
      ways to get a sense of history and to connect with other humans.</p>
    <h3>Eating</h3>
    <p>I mean... who doesn't like to eat?  It's one of the funnest things ever, also, it 
      keeps you from dying.   I shouldn't have to write a whole article to tell you about the 
      merits of nutrients and ingestion.  Next!</p>

    <h3>Movies</h3>
    <p>Ok, now we're talking.  I mean... who doesn't like to watch movies?  I got some 
      recommendations for y'all!  Mostly horror though because that is my jam!  The most perfect 
      and truly scary horror movie ever? I think it's a 3-way tie with the Shining, 28 days later, 
      and Hereditary.  How about something lighter, you say?  Well I got you fam!  I heartily recommend 
      this movie called Idiocracy, it came out like 10+ years ago, and has largely flown under the radar.  
      It is immensely quotable and absurdly prophetic for the times we live in.  Oh, you don't like to 
      laugh?  That's cool, I got something else in the van here for you... how about a rocking musical 
      with an achingly beautiful story and equally amazing songs?  Go check out Hedwig and the Angry Inch!</p>

    <h3>Knitting</h3>
    <p>Check this out, I've been knitting for 10+ years I think.  I first started it because I needed a 
      portable hobby to kill time with, and it just really spiraled out of my control.  Besides generating 
      totally useful end products, the process of knitting is therapeutic for pent-up anxiety, AND 
      squishing yarn balls is literal joy.  After several years of collecting yarn and various fibers (I spin
      yarn too haha), the size of my stash is quite obscene... I don't even want to tell you how much I have, lol.  
      See the picture below with the matching sweaters my husband and I wore in front of a windmill in Amsterdam?  
      I made those!  </p>

    <h3>Krav Maga</h3>
    <p>I don't like exercise, straight up.  However, it is perfectly tolerable if I'm learning something while I 
      exercise.  I grew up on kung fu movies, and like every well-adjusted kid, I fantasize about being a vigilante 
      crime fighter who beat up bad people AND look hella good doing it.  So 5 years ago I decided to do something 
      about it and actually checked out a krav maga gym.  Fell in love and haven't looked back since.  I also dabble 
      in Philipino Martial Arts (FMA) and Brazilian Jujitsu.  Below is a picture of me with a grandmaster of one of 
      the FMA disciplines called Petit Tirsia Kali, he signed my knife lol.</p>

    <h3>Perfumes</h3>
    <p>Shoot, even I'm surprised by how much of a frag-head I am.  But hear me out, you know how some smells can trigger 
      certain memories, or put you in a different mood?  Yeah, I know you'd understand, high five!</p>

          <h2>Hotel</h2>
          <h3>Description</h3> 
          <p>Hotel was a coding project assigned to me at Ada Developer's Academy. It was psuedo hotel booking program that 
              coulg be used by employees who manage bookings and booking data. It was definitely a doozy! It was the first time
              we were given a "blank page" project with almost no pre-written code. It took a few weeks off of my life, but I got through it. 
              You can view my Hotel program via the GitHub link below.

          <h2>Grocery Store</h2>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>Grocery Store was also assigned to me as coursework from Ada Developer's Academy. It was a small program that helped customers keep
            track of the orders they made in a grocery store. This one wasn't as difficult as Hotel, but I still encountered a steep
            learning curve. I think this may actually be my favorite project so far! You can check out my program via the Github link below.

          <h2>Solar System</h2>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p> Solar System was one of the earlier asssiged projects from Ada, where we built a model of a solar system to practice working with
            classes. This program initially helped me to understand class structure more in-depth. The Github link below will take you to my program's repository.

      <section><a href="https://github.com/stupendousC/nim_game/tree/master" target="_blank">Nim game</a></section>
      <section>A classic strategy game I made right before I started Ada Developers Academy, where players take turn removing 1 or 2 or 3 pieces of something.  Whoever ends up having to take the very last piece loses.</section>

      <section><a href="https://github.com/stupendousC/solar-system" target="_blank">Solar System</a></section>
      <section>One of my earlier projects at Ada.  This is a command-line interface program where the user gets to query different pieces of data and also add their own.</section>

      <section><a href="https://github.com/stupendousC/Snake-Game" target="_blank">Snake game</a></section>
      <section>This was one of the very first computer games I got to play as a kid, so it's pretty awesome that I can code it using just HTML.</section>

      <section><a href="https://github.com/stupendousC/hotel" target="_blank">Hotel</a></section>
      <section>Hotel is my most ambitious project yet, done with entirely zero scaffolding or pre-written unit tests.  This project simulates what a hotel front desk clerk does, making reservations and the such.  It took me 1 week to build the basic classes and how they interact with each other.  I learned a lot about single responsibility and the importance of loosely coupled code.  Also, I tested for as many cases as I could, I basically threw the kitchen sink at it.</section>
      <section><a href="https://github.com/stupendousC/stock_portfolio" target="_blank">Stock Portfolio Site</a></section>
      <section>This was my final project for Harvard CS50, I'm pretty proud of it, but they took down their IDE, so all I have right now are the codes I used.</section>
    
      <section><a href="https://github.com/stupendousC/Hangman" target="_blank">Hangman</a></section>
      <section>A hangman-style game (minus the hangman graphics) I made as part of MIT's intro to python class.  That class made me realize how much I love programming.</section>

      <section><a href="https://github.com/stupendousC/recover_images" target="_blank">Recover images</a></section>
      <section>Another project from Harvard CS50, this one was a real doozy.  I had to sift through raw data of a simulated memory card, and look for JPG signatures so I can reconstruct the original JPG images pixel by pixel.</section>

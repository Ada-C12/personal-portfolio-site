      <h2>Learning to let go of my ego</h2>
      <h3>September 29, 2019</h3>
      <p>When I was researching computer science programs and coding bootcamps, I kept coming across the phrase "learning how to learn". Structured learning is great, recent graduates wrote, but learning how to learn is the real key to success.</p>
      <p>"No problem!" I thought. "I went to college. I taught myself mastery of various Microsoft programs and the basics of Ruby. I got this!"</p>
      <div class="wrap-collabsible">
      <input id="collapsible-1" class="toggle" type="checkbox">
      <label for="collapsible-1" class="lbl-toggle">Read more</label>
      <div class="collapsible-content">
      <div class="content-inner">
          <p>Then I started my first week at Ada and came close to collapsing. I knew Ada would be intense -- no one said trying to cram a computer science degree into 11 months would be easy -- but I wasn't prepared for the battering my ego would take, nor for the degree to which my identity was wrapped up in being "the capable one." Before Ada, I was the one who's good with computer stuff, the one who picks up on things quickly, the one can always help with a technical issue. After a few days at Ada, I felt like the slow one, the one who's always last to get it, the clueless dum-dum who's always bugging the people around her for assistance.</p>
          <p>It was pretty rough. Not only was I struggling with the most challenging coursework I'd ever encountered -- post structuralism was a snap compared to nested data structures -- it occured to me that (gasp!) maybe I wasn't as smart as I'd thought. The horror! No matter how many hours I put in, I always felt behind. "Maybe I'm just not cut out to be a developer," I thought.</p>
          <p>I started talking to my classmates and other people in tech with non-traditional backgrounds, who all said they felt the same way at some point. "Trust me, everyone's been there -- repeatedly," my mentor assured me. "I thought about quitting (bootcamp) a lot."</p>
          <p>Eventually I realized that for me, "learning how to learn" means letting go of my ego, accepting my perceived shortcomings with grace, and keeping up that forward momentum. After all, developers are constantly having to learn new things, so it's not like this fish-flopping-around-in-a-bucket feeling is going anywhere. 
          <p>Learning can be uncomfortable. It can be unsettling. It can make you question what you thought you knew about yourself. And that's okay! Because it's also tremendously rewarding, and intellectually stimulating, and just plain interesting. I think it's a fair trade.</p>

      <h2>Why programming?</h2>
      <h3>September 23, 2019</h3>
      <p><em>This post was based on my response to an Ada application essay prompt: "Tell us about your journey thus far to learn about and confirm your interest in programming. What do you love about programming? What is hardest about programming?"</em></p>
      <p>I have a fair amount of software configuration experience -- if you need anything built on Microsoft's SharePoint platform I'm your woman -- but Ada's JumpStart curriculum was my first foray into creating programs from scratch. I expected to find programming interesting the same way I find looking at an engine interesting -- kind of neat but far from thrilling -- so I was taken aback to find out how much I enjoy it.</p> 
      <div class="wrap-collabsible">
      <input id="collapsible-2" class="toggle" type="checkbox">

      <div class="collapsible-content">
      <div class="content-inner">
        <p>There's a creative surge associated with programming that until now I've only experienced in artistic pursuits like songwriting or script polishing, a focused rush that makes everything else recede as all my faculties are aimed at solving the problem of what line comes next in the verse or the script or the program. It's pretty fantastic.</p> 
        <p>Another reason I'm drawn to programming is that I love creating things that are useful. The most satisfying part of my last job was  creating a tool for someone that makes their life easier. Once a nurse manager told me that the tool I built from her specifications saves her at least 5 hours a week, and I was like, "Yesss! Made a DIFFERENCE!"</p>
        <p>The hardest part of programming for me is ignoring the voice in my head that says, "You're not a STEM person. I bet no one else is taking as long as you are to figure this, dummy." Imposter syndrome strikes again! But the more progress I make, the quieter this voice gets and the more trust I have in my abilities.</p>

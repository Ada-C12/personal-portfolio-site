      <h1>About Me</h1>
    </header>

    <section class="page-main">
      <p>I live in lovely Seattle and am a student at <a href="https://www.adadevelopersacademy.org" title="Ada Developers Academy website" target="_blank">Ada Developers Academy</a> (shout out to my fellow Adies and cohort 12 peeps!). </p>
      <p>Before the mid-career pivot to programming, I spent 11 years in hospital operations (think reports and documentation). I learned that while configuring a piece of software can be satisfying, writing my own code is what I'm really passionate about. The power! The responsibility!</p>
      <p>Past lives include newspaper reporter in small-town Alaska, customer service representative at an e-commerce startup, and, like approximately 95 percent of my fellow Seattlelites, barista.</p> 
      <p>Back when I had spare time, I played ukulele for my cat and bassoon with several community groups, including the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thefremontphilharmonic/" title="link to Fremont Philharmonic website" target="_blank">Fremont Philharmonic.</a> I also did lots of cooking, reading, and binging on British TV shoes, and a little hiking and gardening. </p>

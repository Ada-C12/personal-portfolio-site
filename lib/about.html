  <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

  <article class="real-talk">
  <p>Ok, for reals though, who am I?</p>
  <p>I'm a fun-loving individual who plays hard but also works hard.</p>
  <p>Some may say that I'm real "extra", and yeah I'm going to have to agree with that.</p>
  <p>Because what point is living if you're just going to do it half-assed? </p>
  <p>I didn't have a whole lot growing up, but I had curiosity and drive.</p>
  <p>And thank goodness for that, because my life may have turned out quite terribly...</p>
  <p>Why? Well, after I was born, my parents took me to see a fortune teller, this was in Taiwan and it was a different time and culture.</p>
  <p>Anyway, this guy told my parents that I was going to grow up to be a loser, and they believed him.</p>
  <p>I can hear you screaming and I'm with you 100%, he's a jackass.</p>
  <p>I wasn't going to let this define me though... I happened to like school and yeah, I wanted to make a better life for myself too.</p>
  <p>I worked hard both in school and also on my after-school assembly line job.</p>
  <p>I knew that if I wanted something in life, I had to go out there and make it happen for myself.</p>
  <p>Despite early setbacks, I'm aware of how lucky I am and I'm grateful for the many opportunities that have come my way.</p>

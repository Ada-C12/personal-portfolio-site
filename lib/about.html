      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>I have a wide array of interests including music, films, science, exercise, skincare and most recently - software development! 
        I'm facisnated by what motivates human behavior, the mysteries of the human mind, consciousness and what constitues a "happy life." I also like analyzing
        modern society, including the benefits of technology and some of its downsides. 
      
        My music library runs the gamut including Radiohead, Michael Jackson, Chaka Khan, Jack White, Lady Gaga, and Joep Beving. I've seen almost ever Oscar-winning film and can recite Daniel Day Lewis' 
        "milkshake" scene from "There Will Be Blood."
      
        In addition, I exercise on a consistent basis to ensure the machine I call my body runs efficiently. Life is only as good as the health of your body.</p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I have a degree in Public Relations from The University of Alabama. I moved here from Alabama in December 2017 to intern with a public relations firm called Edelman.
        I worked in the PR industry for a while until I realized that it was unfortunately not for me. From there, I discovered software development and now am a full-time student at
        the prestigous Ada Developer's Academy! I'm immersed in a new world learning Ruby, Ruby on Rails and eventually JavaScript!

      <h1>Nice to Meet You!</h1>
      <div class="intro">
        <p>My name is Mariya Burrows. I am a software developer in training. I currently attend Ada Developers Academy in Seattle, WA. 
          In my past life, I owned a speech langauge pathology private practice, where I specialized in early intervention, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and motor speech disorders in pediatric populations. Right now, I am interested in learning about how technology can be leveraged to increase accessability and/or improve clinical outcomes for patient populations. I think tech can save the world, and it can probably help improve the healthcare industry along the way, too!

        <p>Lastly, I'll leave you with a list of my current obsessions because that's the best, most honest summary I can give of myself.
          In no particular order, I am so-so obsessed with:
          <ul>
            <li>cats in general, but especially my cat, Tommy.</li>
            <li>Mindy Kaling, Victoria Beckham, Meghan Markle, Johnathan Van Nass, Jameela Jamil, Serena Williams, Dr.Nadine Burke Harris</li>
            <li>baking</li>
            <li>The Good Place (TV show)</li>
            <li>The Seattle Aquarium (I got married there)</li>
            <li>Seattle Central Library (the architecture really gets me pumped up to read)</li>
            <li>...libraries in general. We are so lucky to live in a world where libraries exist.</li>
            <li>Pioneer Square is my favorate neighborhood in Seattle. I love walking through Occidental Park in the evening when the park lights are on. So pretty, such a mood lifter!</li>
            <li>I love reading nonfiction, and loathe fiction. It's been years since I've completed a fiction novel.</li>
          </ul>

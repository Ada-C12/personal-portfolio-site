        <p class="me_stuff">My name is Mariya Burrows. I am a software developer in training. I currently attend Ada Developers Academy in Seattle, WA. 
          In my past life, I owned a speech langauge pathology private practice, where I specialized in early intervention, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and motor speech disorders in pediatric populations. Right now, I am interested in learning about how technology can be leveraged to increase accessability and/or improve clinical outcomes for patient populations. I think tech can save the world, and it can probably help improve the healthcare industry along the way, too!

        <p class="me_stuff">Lastly, I'll leave you with a list of my current obsessions because that's the best, most honest summary I can give of myself.
          In no particular order, I am so-so obsessed with:
          <h2>Get to Know Me</h3>

            <li>Pioneer Square is my favorate neighborhood in Seattle. I love walking through Occidental Park in the evening when the park lights are on. So pretty, such a mood lifter!</li>

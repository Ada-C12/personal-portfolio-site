          <h3>playing things</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>soccer!</h4>
              <p>i am a little bit ... not good at soccer. but it's ok because I play with a really relaxed, fun group of people in an all levels recreational league, and I am slowly but surely improving! I was so bad at sports during school, I just stuck to playing my flute. So glad I started playing soccer in 2016 though :) I encourage you to play team sports if you don't already, especially if you think you can't, because it is so fun!!! and great exercise.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>soccar!</h4>
              <p>aka Rocket League! I am very bad at this btw, but I enjoy it. I honestly feel like it prepares me better for irl soccer games!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>board&card games!</h4>
              <p>I am not sure how it happened, but a couple of years ago I started getting really into board and card games. I love trying to win!! I get tired of games I own after a while and always have to find a new one to play.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>video games!</h4>
              <p>my favorite video games have mostly been the ones played on the same screen as other people ~ competitive (like pokemon stadium, wario ware, jackbox games, samurai gunn), cooperative (rocket league as mentioned before, overcooked, lovers in a dangerous spacetime, rock band), or weird (wattam) ~ I just love to play with other people in the same room as me!</p>

            <h3>watching cartoons</h3>
            <p>There are some great cartoons out there</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h4>Studio Ghibli</h4>
                <p>First things first - Studio Ghibli is amazing. Studio Ghibli movies are in the most basic sense, the Disney movies of Japan. Please at least watch Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, or Princess Mononoke. My absolute favorite though, is Ponyo. Sorry not sorry!!!</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Bee and Puppycat</h4>
                <p>This is a super cute project of Natasha Allegri's, who worked on Adventure Time. It's just so cute. A very cool side character named Cass Wizard is software engineer and wrestler!</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Manly</h4>
                <p>Okay, I saw this a long time ago, it was basically just a pilot and hasn't evolved into a series, but I can't stop thinking about how much I liked it. It was a short on Cartoon Hangover, just like Bee and Puppycat was, and the creators also worked on Adventure Time. Its main character is a super strong space princess who wants to be evil like her dad, but her little sidekick encourages her to pursue writing poetry, which she enjoys and is great at.</p>

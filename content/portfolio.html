    <h1>Some recent projects at Ada</h1>
    <a href="https://github.com/in-formation/hotel"><h2>Hotel</h2></a>
    <p>This was a difficult project where we really had to think about object-oriented design from scratch. No code was given to us. Organizing our classes and methods within those classes was key to meeting the objectives of the assignment.</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/in-formation/startrly"><h2>Startrly</h2></a>
    <p>For this project we practiced our HTML and CSS skills...sort of like what I'm doing here. ;)</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/in-formation/array-string-practice"><h2>Sorted Arrays</h2></a>
    <p>Part of the Ada curriculum includes Computer Science fundamentals which includes algorithms for sorting arrays. This sort of information is helpful when the time comes to prepare for technical interviews.</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/kristyh32/oo-ride-share"><h2>Object-Oriented Rideshare</h2></a>
    <p>This project was a pair project and it tested our usage of methods, modules and CSV data. Not only did we have to learn how to read data from a CSV, but we needed to understand how to manipulate it with our different classes. It also tested our usage of test-driven-development.</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/in-formation/grocery-store"><h2>Grocery Store</h2></a>
    <p>This project was where we first tested our Test-Driven-Development skills. The purpose of TDD is to ensure that our code is functioning the way it is supposed to. Additionally, the reason we focus on doing testing first prior to writing any code, is to understand how our code will and will not function.</p>

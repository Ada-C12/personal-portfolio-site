      <h2>Hi, my name is Farah Davoodi</h2>
      <p>A little about me...I'm a software developer in training at Ada Developer's Academy. I'm part of Cohort 12, specifically in the Branches class. After working in the aerospace industry for some time, I decided to make a change and follow another passion I had but needed guidance and support with. Programming! It hasn't been easy but I'm learning a lot and enjoying the process.</p>

      <p>I have mastered Ruby in its entirety...</p>
      <p>Just kidding! But through Ada Developer's Academy, I have practiced Ruby fundamentals in conjunction with object-oriented design.</p>
      <p>A list projects I have completed or currently working on can  be found on my <a href="https://github.com/in-formation">GitHub page (click me).</a></p>

      <h4>Cinephile, Cinemaphile, Moviebuff, etc.</h4>
      <p>In 2017 I made a resolution to see a minimum of 52 movies (averaging 1 a week). I made it to 55 movies with 60% of the movies being watched in a movie theater, 25% whilst traveling via airplane and the rest watching at home. Even though life can get hectic, I always make a conscious effort to watch movies at a local theater because I truly believe in the movie theater experience.</p>
      <h4>Spinning!</h4>
      <p>Not much to say about this one besides that I love to jam out on a bicycle (indoors) and pedal out my feelings.</p>

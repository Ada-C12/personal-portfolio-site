    <p>I’m a full-stack software developer student at Ada Developers Academy. In my previous life, I was an accountant
      and I decided to change my career when I realized that coding is a synonym of empowering. What I most love about
      coding is that is so powerful that it can change and improve lives.</br></p>
    <p>I’m passionate about finding solutions to problems and I love to learn new things every day. I believe that
      diversity and equity are what enriches a team. Thanks for checking out my website. Get in touch!</p>

    <p id="profile-text">Hi, my name is Dianna Tingg.</br></br>
      I'm currently a full-stack software engineering student at <a href="https://adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Developers Academy</a> in Seattle, Washington. 
      I will graduate in June 2020.<br><br>
      Ada is an intensive training program for women and gender diverse people who want to become software developers.
      It includes six months of full-time classroom instruction followed by five months in a paid industry internship.<br><br>
      The curriculum includes Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git.
      We are also learning about computer science fundamentals, test-driven development, pair programming, leadership principles, social justice, and inclusion.<br><br>
      Before Ada, I was working in the healthcare industry as a Quality Program Manager. My specialty was in Medicare regulations and electronic medical record systems.

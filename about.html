      <p class="title">Work History</p>
      <p>I graduated from Western Washington University with a degree in psychology. I hold certifications as a Registered Behavior Technician (national) and Certified Behavior Technician (WA state) in Applied Behavior Analysis, and formerly worked as a therapist to support and instruct children and adolescents facing behavioral and developmental challenges in their lives. Prior to that, I was a research assistant for the University of Washington at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, on a study investigating the changes in the cognitive processing of women after completing chemotherapy.

      <p>Hi, my name is Dianna Tingg.<br><br>
        I'm currently a full-stack software engineering student at <a id="ada-link" href="https://adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Developers Academy</a> in Seattle, Washington. 
        I will graduate in June 2020.<br><br>
        Ada is an intensive training program for women and gender diverse people who want to become software developers.
        It includes six months of full-time classroom instruction followed by five months in a paid industry internship.<br><br>
        The curriculum includes Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git.
        We are also learning about computer science fundamentals, test-driven development, pair programming, leadership principles, social justice, and inclusion.<br><br>
        Before Ada, I was working in the healthcare industry as a Quality Program Manager. I specialized in Medicare regulations and electronic medical record systems.<br><br>
        In my spare time, I like to write business reviews. I've been a member of the <a id="yelp-link" href="https://www.yelp.com/elite">Yelp Elite Squad</a> for two years. Check out my blog for some of my reviews.

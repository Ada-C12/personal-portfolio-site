<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I like when things clash. When completely unrelated things come together and make a cohesive unit even though by societies standards they shouldn’t.
  I love oxymorons, and I would describe myself as someone who contradicts not only societies standards, but my own constantly. It is who I am.
  When I was a little girl I would wear pink, even though I hated the color, or more so I hated what it came to represent: delicate, fragile, pretty, quiet. 
  I wanted to wear the color because I didn’t think of myself as those things and wanted to push back against those standards. I wanted to change the meaning
  of what that color meant. It is why wore a pink shirt the first day of my automotive class.It is why I entered the automotive field, meanwhile pushing back against
  the idea that I had to be one of the guys to be there. Still, let’s be real it hasn’t been easy. It has always been hard for people to read me and understand where 
  I fit and has at times made me so alone and isolated; but by being myself I have been able to change minds and get people to think outside of their rigid standards 
  as to who belongs where. 
  
  Now I am Ada surrounded by incredible people who like myself have pushed boundaries and are transitioning into a new field in desperate need of diversity.
  To say it has been hard for me is an understatement, this is the hardest thing I have ever done! Everyday I have to overcome fear that I don’t belong here, 
  that I am not smart enough to learn the material and up until now it has been debilitating to the point that it has caused me to feel a panic and anxiety that
  has caused me to intellectually and emotionally checkout. I have moved States to be in a new city, I have taken out another loan to be here. 
  I am away from comfort and family. I am scared of failure and all that coupled with the intensity of the program has caused me to panic. There was a point recently 
  where I wanted to pack up my truck and leave! What stopped me? I reminded myself why I came here in the first place. To make an impact, to change the world for the
  better in which ever way I can. To find a way to leverage technology to help those people who aren’t in the position to leverage it themselves.I want to challenge 
  peoples assumptions and take my vast experiences to make the world a better place. I am not here for myself I am here for all the people who don’t have this amazing 
  opportunity.

      <p>I'm a current software development student at Ada Developers Academy. I began my career as an archivist, but after a few years became enthralled with the new technologies I was using and decided I wanted to learn more about how software was built. When I'm not practicing my coding, I love baking, bookbinding, doing a good jigsaw puzzle, watching British television, exploring new places, and trying new things. I also enjoy going to hockey games (Go Sharks!) and am axiously awaiting the new Seattle NHL team!</p>

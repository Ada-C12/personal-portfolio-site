        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>My name is Daniela Sanchez. My pronouns are she/her. I was born in Chile and moved to United States in 2016 because of the love of a man that is now my husband. I live in the beautiful city of Snoqualmie, surrounded by trees. During my free time, I try to spend time in the outdoors as much as I can. If the weather is cold I like to go for coffee to a french bakery!</p>

        <h1>Lifelong learner</h1>
        <p>Before I decided to change career and become a developer, I went to Nursing School, but dropped after two years due to lack of passion. Then, I went to Business School where I got a Bachelor in Business Administration and a Master in Finance. My first job was at DocuSign where I worked for two years as Sales Operations Analyst. The repetitive tasks of my job, and problems with our CRM made me to want to pursue software engineering to learn automation and programming skills. Now, I'm currently a student at Ada Developers Academy to became a software engineer.</p>

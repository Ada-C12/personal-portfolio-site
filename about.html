      <p>Hi, I'm Kristy Hisaw, former paralegal turned software developer.</p>
      <p>I've always loved puzzles, and software has allowed me to combine my
        love of problem solving and my creativity in a really fulfilling way.
        There's just so many interesting problems out there to solve!
      </p>
      <p>Born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, I have always had a deep love
        for nature, the outdoors, and animals. Cats in particular have a special place in my heart.
        I have three adorable kitties pictured above, who live with my partner and myself.
      </p>
      <p>My hobbies include travel, Bob Ross style painting, and makeup artistry.</p>

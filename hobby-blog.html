      <strong>Introduction</strong>
      <p>When prepared with a skillful hand, food is an art. However, this type of art is not
          one that withstands time. Food is meant to be enjoyed, consumed, lest it go to waste.
          When food is consumed it is essentially destroyed; it cannot be reconstructed in the same
          way. This destruction in itself can be viewed as a step in the cycle of art. The Japanese as
          a culture and society value food as an art form, recognizing that the consumer should
          enjoy the food before its proverbial destruction. Mono no aware, which will be
          introduced in greater detail, is a Japanese term that encompasses this process of the life
          cycle of art, including its destruction.</p>
        <p>
          Throughout this chapter, the Japanese aesthetics of mono no aware and kodawari
          will be introduced and applied to examples in context, such as Japanese tea ceremony, to
          provide the reader a more thorough understanding of how these aesthetics influence the
          food and service industry in a later chapter.</p>
      <strong>Mono No Aware</strong>
      <p>
      Deconstructing the Japanese aesthetic term, mono no aware, is no simple task.
      The term carries with it centuries of meaning and depth, but is still applicable because it
      remains relevant to modern Japan. More than just a term, mono no aware is a mindset:
      the awareness of impermanence, the appreciation of the fleeting beauty in the cycle of
      life. Specifically applicable in nature, mono no aware emphasizes a respect and reverence
      for natural beauty, both in its prime element and in its passing.
      </p>
      <p>
      During an interview with Portland based artist, Saager Dilawri, Zero1 Magazine
      asked him to define mono no aware, as he has been known to say it is a key influence in
      his work. “It is a Japanese idea,” he states, “like a perfect notion of seeing a leaf decaying
      with light catching it. Letting things be in their natural state and understanding that
      nothing lasts forever. Time has an effect that nothing is perfect and that there is beauty in
      everything” (Dilawri, p. 8). Mono no aware is the awareness of impermanence
      verbalized.

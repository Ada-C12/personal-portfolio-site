          <h1>Calculator</h1>
          <p>In this project I created a simple calculator to perform addition, substraction, multiplication and division of two numbers. The main goal of this project was to practice writing Ruby code: conditional statements, loops, accepting user input, creating and using variables and methods.</p>

          <h1>Adagrams</h1>
          <p>This was a pair project to practice writing Ruby and specifically methods. The tests were provided, so the main goal was to write code to pass all the tests.</p>

          <h1>Rideshare</h1>
          <p>In this project I learned how to organize data into a nested data structure for returning information. My project used an Array of Hashes to organize the data of an Excel sheet. Each Hash was a driver and each driver had keys that store strings or arrays.<p>

          <h1>Solar System</h1>
          <p>This was the first project of object-oriented programming. The main goal was to practice with classes and their methods. In this project I created a class planet and a class solar system. In addition, I created a command line interface to allow the user to interact with these classes."</p>

          <p>This was a project to keep track of the orders made in a grocery store. In this project I practiced extracting data from a CSV file, working with nested data structures, object composition, instance variables and methods, and testing.</p>

          <h1>Hotel</h1>
          <p>This was the last project of the Ruby unit. In this project I had to build a booking system for a hotel. For that, I had to use everything I learned about ruby and object-oriented principles. Also, I had to create tests to verify that my program was doing what I expected as it didn't have user interface.</p>

          <h1>Slack</h1>
          <p>In this project I practiced working with API (get and post). My project is a complete command-line application that interacts  with Slack to receive data and to send messages to a channel or user. In addition, I created tests to validate the behavior of my application.</p>

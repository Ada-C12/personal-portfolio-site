    <p>Finding your own study style is challenging, but necessary. Luckily, there are a lot of existing resources and ideas, as well as your own understanding of yourself and your own creativity!</p>
    
    <p>Finding your own study style will take a lot of time, a lot of experimentation, and a lot of feedback from yourself to figure out what works.</p>
    
    <p>Your peers, your instructors, and the Ada staff are all prepared and excited to help you find your best study style!</p>
    
    <p>When you find your best way of how you like to study, those skills will carry over into internships and jobs, so you can confidently say that you have learned how to learn effectively.</p>

        <a href="https://github.com/gracexinran/adagrams">Adagrams</a>
        <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase. Adagrams is a fictional game in which a player is given a random set of letters and must make an anagram using those letters. Adagrams has a specific scoring system, so that the player's submitted anagram scores points. The rules for Adagrams are roughly inspired by the "Letter Round" portion of the British game show Countdown. While working on Adagrams, it may help to think of a physical metaphor for this game, such as other common word games like Scrabble or Bananagrams. These analog games all feature a pool of letter tiles that the player draws from.</p>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> We will make a Ruby implementation of Adagrams that runs in the command line. The program should also pass the provided unit tests.</p>

        <a href="https://github.com/CEsGutierrez/oo-ride-share">OO-Ride-Share</a>
        <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Remember the ride share exercise we did with designing and creating a system to track the ride share data from a CSV file? We did a lot of great work on creating arrays and hashes of data, but we've learned a lot since then! Now, we're going to use our understanding of classes, methods and attributes to create an object-oriented implementation of our ride share system.</p>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> We will build a Ruby library that loads lists of passengers, trips and drivers from CSV files, provides methods for exploring this data, and provides a way to request a new trip. We will not write an interactive command-line program.</p>

        <a href="https://github.com/gracexinran/hotel">Hotel</a>
        <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Our company has been contracted to build a booking system for a small hotel. This system will be used by employees who manage bookings and booking data, and will not be available to the general public.</p>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> For our hotel booking system, we should make a module full of business logic that tracks which rooms are reserved, and at what dates. This should be organized into appropriate classes and methods. We should use tests to verify that this system works as intended. We should not build a CLI for this project.</p>

        <a href="https://github.com/michaela260/slack-cli">Slack CLI</a>
        <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> To practice working with APIs, we will utilize the API for a tool with which you already very familiar: Slack! The application we build this week will be designed for humans to use. This means the format will be familiar to us, but it seems a little silly - why would you use the command line when you could just use the app? However, there are many places where you might want to use Slack, where it doesn't make sense to have a human in the loop. For example, you might set up a continuous integration tool like Travis CI to run your tests automatically whenever you submit a pull request. Travis has the ability to post in your Slack channel when the tests are done, using the Slack API in a way similar to the way we will in this project.</p>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> We will write a complete command-line application that interacts with Slack. This application will be able to: List users and channels; See details about a user or channel; Send a message to a user or channel</p>

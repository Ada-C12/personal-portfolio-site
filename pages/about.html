        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Born and raised in Boston, I moved to Seattle in the fall of 2018 to serve as an AmeriCorps member at the University of Washington. Through my work as the STEM Enrichment Coordinator of a program for high school students, I became intersted in coding and software development.</p>
        <p>I have always loved learning and innovating creative solutions to problems. My past academic experience was focused on social sciences, and I earned my undergraduate degree in Political Science with a minor in Psychology. I love that coding gives me the opportunity to tackle new types of challenges and gives me a set of tools that I could not previously utilize. Throughout my life, I have also loved studying foreign languages including French, Arabic, and Spanish. I am looking forward to using my language-learning skills as I approach new programming languages throughout my career.</p>
        <p>I began classes at Ada Developer's Academy in August 2019, and I will complete a technical internship as part of the program from February - July 2020.</p>

            <p class="project-description">Don't call my escorts whores. Michael, you are not quite the ladies man I had pictured. Hopefully, we will remedy that when we are in the spa spreading body chocolate on each other. You're losing blood, aren't you? Gob: Probably, my socks are wet. I hate the Wetlands. They're stupid and wet, and there are bugs everywhere, and I think I maced a crane. Don't call my escorts whores.</p>

Ann certainly has a great deal of Mass. Absolutely. And we're going to be here every day. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. I call it Tricks –- wait for it – Around The Office. Oh, yeah. The guy in the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. COME ON! No. I was ashamed to be _seen_ with you. I like being with you.</p>
